# Testing

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the testing strategy and methodologies used to ensure the quality and reliability
of the PyThings package. It includes instructions on how to run the tests, the types of tests included, and the tools
used for testing.

## Testing Strategy

The PyThings package employs a comprehensive testing strategy that includes the following types of tests:

- **[Unit Tests](unit/unit_testing.md)**: Verify the functionality of individual components in isolation.
- **[Integration Tests](integration/integration_testing.md)**: Ensure that different components of the package work
  together as expected.
- **[End-to-End Tests](e2e/e2e_testing.md)**: Simulate real-world usage scenarios to validate the overall behavior of
  the package.

## Tools and Frameworks

The following tools and frameworks are used for testing the PyThings package:

- **pytest**: A framework for writing and running tests.
- **unittest**: The built-in Python module for writing and running tests.
- **tox**: A tool for automating testing across multiple environments.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for the PyThings package, follow these steps:

1. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

2. **Run the tests using pytest**:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

3. **Run the tests using tox**:
    ```bash
    tox
    ```

## Writing Tests

When writing tests for the PyThings package, follow these guidelines:

- **[Unit Tests](unit/unit_testing.md)**: Place unit tests in the `tests/unit` directory. Each test file should
  correspond to a module in the package.
- **[Integration Tests](integration/integration_testing.md)**: Place integration tests in the `tests/integration`
  directory. These tests should cover interactions between multiple components.
- **[End-to-End Tests](e2e/e2e_testing.md)**: Place end-to-end tests in the `tests/e2e` directory. These tests should
  simulate real-world usage scenarios.

## Example Test

Here is an example of a simple unit test for the `validate_error_code` function:

```python
import pytest
from pythings.__errors__ import validate_error_code

def test_validate_error_code():
    assert validate_error_code(100) == True
    assert validate_error_code(999) == False
