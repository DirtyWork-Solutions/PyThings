# PyThings

__THIS PROJECT IS IN ALPHA!__ _YOU HAVE  BE WARNED!_
****

The __PyThings__ project is an attempt at providing a modular and comprehensive library for abstracting, managing and
defining... well everything and anything.

Initially appeared on
[gist](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2). But the page cannot open anymore so that is why I have moved it here.

## Getting Started

your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## Extending & Expanding
